Install
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

To use of Paramak you will need Python 3 installed using Miniconda or Anaconda, or Miniforge

* `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_ recommended as it includes Mamba 
* `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
* `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_



Once you have a version of Mamba or Conda installed then proceed with the Paramak specific steps.


Install (mamba)
---------------

This is the recommended method as it installs all the dependencies and Mamba is faster and requires less RAM than the pure Conda method.

Create a new environment (with your preferred python version).

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba create --name paramak_env python=3.11


Then activate the new environment.

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba activate paramak_env


Then install the Paramak.

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba install -c conda-forge paramak

Now you should be ready to import paramak from your new python environment.

Install (conda)
---------------

Create a new environment (with your preferred python version).

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create --name paramak_env python=3.11


Then activate the new environment.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate paramak_env

Then install the Paramak.

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba install -c conda-forge paramak

Now you should be ready to import paramak from your new python environment.



Developer Installation
----------------------

If you want to contribute to the paramak or then you might want to install the
package in a more dynamic manner.

Download and install MiniConda, create a new python environment and activate the
environment as covered in the installation procedure above.

Then install CadQuery with Conda, Mamba or pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge cadquery
    mamba install -c conda-forge cadquery
    pip install cadquery


Then clone the repository

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak.git

Navigate to the paramak repository and within the terminal install the paramak
package and the dependencies using pip with e -e (developer option).

.. code-block:: bash

   cd paramak
   pip install -e .
